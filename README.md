I'm currently studying Computer Science at UT Dallas and Software Engineering Intern at NCR Corporation for Summer 2022. I'm seeking opportunities for internship/co-op positions for the coming Fall Semester as well. I am passionate about developing all kinds of software from machine learning to web design. I am most skilled in Java, C++, Python, JavaScript (React & NodeJS) and HTML/CSS.
Some of my hobbies include piano and tennis.
